# myProjects
my little coding 

Well i am more into drawing and illustration but to make some money i moved to something more practical.
And so i got into web design. I did icons, vector graphics etc. But soon i realised that it would be nice to at least have
some basic CSS and HTML. And now i am here learning JS.

Here i will post my most basic complete beginner level stuff in JS that barely works and does not use any libraries.
I hope someone new to JS will find these projects useful and learn something new.
